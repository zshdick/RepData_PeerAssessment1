The Course Project is an important component of this course and most of the other courses in the Data Science Specialization. Course Projects are usually evaluated and graded through peer assessment. You must submit your Course Project by the specified deadline to receive credit for your submission. Course Project deadlines are not flexible, and  you may not apply Late Days to Course Projects.
The Course Project in The Data Scientist's Toolbox is worth 40% of the final grade.
To access the submission interface, scroll to the bottom of this page and click the blue Go To Assignment button.
Time    What happens then
Course Project submission starts at the beginning of Week 1
You can see the Course Project assignment and start working on it. You can save drafts of your work as you go along, and you can come back later to continue working on your draft. When you're ready to submit your work for evaluation, remember to click the "Submit" button. If the deadline passes and you haven't clicked "Submit" yet, then your saved draft will not be evaluated.
Note: You can submit and re-submit your work for evaluation as many times as you want before the submission deadline, without any penalty. Only your last submission will be seen and evaluated by your classmates.
Submissions due by the end of Week 3 (BEFORE 11:30 PM UTC on Sunday)	After this time, you can no longer change your Course Project submission. If you have not clicked the "Submit" button by this time, your classmates will not see your submission, you will not receive an evaluation for this assignment, and you will not be permitted to evaluate your classmates' submissions.
Evaluation starts at the beginning of Week 4
After this time, you will evaluate the Course Project Submissions of at least four of your classmates. If you don't evaluate at least four, your own grade on the Course Project will be reduced by 20%.
Optionally, you can choose to evaluate the work of even more of your classmates before the evaluation deadline passes. This is very helpful for the success of the course.
Remember: as with the submission stage, this evaluation stage is required if you want your own assignment submission to be evaluated.
Evaluations due by the end of Week 4 (BEFORE 11:30 PM UTC on Sunday)	After this time, you can no longer evaluate the work your peers. If you have not finished your assigned evaluation tasks by this time, your own Course Project Grade will be reduced by 20%.
